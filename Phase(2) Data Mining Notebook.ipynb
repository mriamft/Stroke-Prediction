    "Stroke is the second-leading cause of death and the most common global cause of disability. WHO estimates that 1 in 4 persons may experience a stroke during their lifetime; because strokes can occur at any time and to anyone, regardless of age, we have chosen to concentrate on this dataset. Given the sudden nature of strokes, we intend to investigate and analyze the data to provide predictions on what are some risk factors and shed light on the types of people who are likely to experience one, allowing for future changes in lives. This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age,bmi, various diseases such as hypertension and heart disease, smoking status,marital  status and residence type. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.\n"

    "Data mining plays a crucial role in predicting the probability of having a stroke through classification and clustering techniques. By applying data mining algorithms to a large dataset containing various health-related features, valuable patterns and relationships can be discovered. In the classification aspect, data mining aids in building models that can accurately classify individuals into different categories, such as 1 for \"stroke\" or 0 for \"non-stroke,\" based on their attributes and risk factors. This helps in identifying individuals who are more likely to experience a stroke, enabling proactive interventions and preventive measures. On the other hand, clustering techniques assist in identifying groups or clusters of individuals with similar characteristics, allowing for a deeper understanding of stroke risk factors and potential subgroups within the population. By leveraging data mining in stroke prediction, healthcare professionals and researchers can gain valuable insights and develop effective strategies for stroke prevention, early detection, and personalized treatments."

Consequently, our baseline dummy model achieves an accuracy of 95% by consistently predicting that individuals do not have a stroke. When evaluating our model, an essential metric to consider is sensitivity, also known as recall or the probability of detection.

In this case, the dummy model has a sensitivity of 0 since it fails to identify any true positives.\n",
