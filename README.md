# Stroke-Prediction

Stroke is the second-leading cause of death and the most common global cause of disability. WHO estimates that 1 in 4 persons may experience a stroke during their lifetime; because strokes can occur at any time and to anyone, regardless of age, we have chosen to concentrate on this dataset. 
Given the sudden nature of strokes, we intend to investigate and analyze the data to provide predictions on what are some risk factors and shed light on the types of people who are likely to experience one, allowing for future changes in lives.
This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.
